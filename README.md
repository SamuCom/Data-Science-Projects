## Network Analysis

### Project 1: [Enron crash]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal)) email network analysis

#### Overview

The Enron accounting scandal in 2001 resulted in the arrest of employees involved in fraudulent activities. In this study, I have analysed the Enron email database and employed network analysis techniques to assess whether it was possible to determine the key culprits of the fraud within the email network.

#### Techniques Used

- [List the network analysis techniques or algorithms used in the project.]

#### Results

The analysis successfully identified four of the individuals that were indeed charged in the Enron scandal out of a network of around 8,300 individuals.
It is important to acknowledge that the findings do not encompass all individuals convicted. Factors such as the effectiveness of legal representation and other external variables can influence legal proceedingsâ€™ outcomes.
The network analysis focused solely on communication patterns, disregarding the content of emails, internal documents, testimonies, and other sources of information.
The analysis also highlighted the role of those involved but not formally charged, provideing valuable insights into the overall dynamics of the Enron scandal. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the complex network of relationships within Enron during the investigated period and the broader context of the scandal.
